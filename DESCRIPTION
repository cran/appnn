Description: Amyloid propensity prediction neural network (APPNN) is an amyloidogenicity propensity predictor based on a machine learning approach through recursive feature selection and feed-forward neural networks, taking advantage of newly published sequences with experimental, in vitro, evidence of amyloid formation.
